Hey everybody👋🏼

In this project I recreated Frank Dvorek game project, in which you will have to protect the Earth from alien fish species🛸😱.
<br><br>
The project is a 2D games with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and HTML Canvas. From sprite animation to parallax backgrounds, today we will build a game completely from scratch, with no frameworks and no libraries, using just HTML, CSS and plain vanilla JavaScript.
